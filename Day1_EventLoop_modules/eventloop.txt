1.what is event-loop?
2.what is asynchornous programming?
3.Execution of asynchornous programs?


Fact: Javascript is a single threaded language,but how we are able to excecute asynchornous code in Js need to be investigated...

In Javascript environment we have the following main components,

1.Event-loop
2.Libuv
3.call-stack

1.Call-stack: is where out code is acutally excecuted,all the program is excecuted in call stack
2.libuv is c++ library that acutally interacts with kernal to excecute asynchornous tasks
3.Event-loop: its is like a manager of asynchornous code excecution
.It takes control only when call stack is empty.Then it executes every callbacks in a specific order.


Order of Execution in event loop:

1. callbacks in microtask queue(1st : nextick, 2nd: promises)
2.timer queue(between every timer queue it goes into microtask everytime)
3.Io queue(same here also it goes into microtask queue after every call back)
4.check queue(same here)
5.close queue(same here)
6.checks microtask queue again at the end of iteration



 event loop archietectue

    timer queue--->Io queue----->check queue------>close queue----->timer queue
